### What I learned

I learned much but the css max-width property stood out for me and i was able to put my knowledge of pseudo-elements into practice.


```css
proud of this css code
.body p::first-letter {
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
```


### Continued development

How the width and max-width works interchangebaly is still a torn in the flesh for me and definitely it is an area i am looking to improve as well as working with the responsiveness
